    <span>E-learning and collaboration tools</span><p>are part of the knowledge distribution process,
which is extremely important in healthcare, since continuous education is a key
    factor in effective practice of care</p>
    <p>The essence of effective knowledge management does not rely on the use of one or more
existing or forthcoming information technology tools. It is mostly about people, about
processes and about capturing the results of people following processes, about transforming information into knowledge (explicit or tacit) and reusing it within a healthcare
framework</p>
    <h1>Performance Management:
Monitor and Manage Healthcare</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In order to persuade healthcare decision makers to assess the added value of KM tools,
the latter should initially be used to propose new performance measurement and
performance management techniques at all levels of a healthcare system (Hurst & JeeHughes, 2001). In that sense, performance management has long been considered as a
tool for controlling spending and for increasing the efficiency of healthcare systems
(Oxley & MacFarlan, 1994). There are three broad goals that governments generally
pursue in the healthcare area:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Equity: where citizens should have access to some incompressible minimum level
of healthcare and treatment based on the need for care rather that solely on income.</li>
    <li>Micro-economic efficiency: where quality of care and consumer satisfaction
should be maximized at minimum cost</li>
    <li>Macroeconomic cost control: where the healthcare sector should consume an
        “appropriate” share of GDP.</li></ol>
<p>In addition, healthcare systems are often facing factors that put pressure on the system.
As a consequence, an effective performance management framework is the only solution
towards controlling factors such as:</p>
    <ol>
 <li>Population aging</li>
 <li>Increased income and higher demand for healthcare services;</li>
 <li>Increased access to healthcare services; and</li>
  <li>Increase of high technology usage which in turn increases the healthcare services
      usage creating sometime unnecessary demand (from a medical point of view).</li></ol>
<h5>Berler, Pavlopoulos and Koutsouris</h5>
<p>Most existing policies for controlling the performance of healthcare systems were based
upon financial assessment of past results (macroeconomic control of spending and
micro-efficiency improvements) by giving incentives to payers and providers of a
healthcare system. By its very nature the financial measurements are not forward looking
and are exclusionary to non-financial measures. In addition, the emergence of the
Information Society in the late 90s rendered many of the fundamental performance
management assumptions obsolete. Information Society has brought a new set of
assumptions that institutions have to include into their strategy. Amongst others we
could refer to:</p>
    <ol>
  <li>The cross functional aspects of processes based upon specialisation, increased
skills and high technology</li>
 <li>The integration of processes in the healthcare sector from the suppliers to the
patient and the ability to manage and monitor materials upon requests and needs</li>
<li>The ability to offer specific services to patients in accordance to their needs while
being able to constraint costs of this customised care. In fact this is the essence
of managed care: providing satisfactory and high quality of care at a reasonable
cost.</li>
<li>The ability to offer specific services to patients in accordance to their needs while
being able to constraint costs of this customised care. In fact this is the essence
of managed care: providing satisfactory and high quality of care at a reasonable
cost.</li>
<li>The global scale of healthcare: This sector is no exception to any other global
marketplace, thus making healthcare delivery more comparable at a national or
regional level and within accepted standards (e.g., clinical procedure guidelines)</li>
 <li>Innovation, which has been a key driver towards quality of care and quality of life
for many years in the healthcare sector</li>
<li>Knowledge workers: the increasing complexity of medicine and technology has
created a need for highly skilled personnel at every level of a healthcare institution.
Employee empowerment is driven by knowledge as it is created in the daily process
    of delivering healthcare services.</li></ol>
<p>Nowadays, performance measurement is moving towards the adoption of a set of
objectives for a healthcare system. To our knowledge, there is no complete agreement
on what is meant by “performance” of health systems and many sets of objectives are
generally proposed. The use of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) helps to establish this
set of objectives more thoroughly by focusing on the real needs.</p>
<h1>Using Balanced Scorecards</h1>
    <hr>
<p>In order to address the issue of creating a set of KPIs , the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)
framework (Kaplan, 2001; Norton & Kaplan, 1996) initially proposed by Kaplan and
Norton for the strategic management of financial organizations in the mid 1990s, is one
of the most suited approaches in that direction. This model has now proven its value and
since it is a generic framework it is applicable to the healthcare sector. The BSC concept
involves creating a set of measurements and objectives for four strategic perspectives:</p>
<p>Financial: financial performance measures typically indicate whether a proposed
strategy implementation and execution is contributing to bottom line improvements, based upon an accurate summary of economic consequences of actionsalready taken.</p>
    <p>Customer (i.e., the Patient): this perspective is a set of objectives that focuses on
identifying the patient’s needs, the targeted market (this could be the case of a
specialised institution) and on measuring the performance of each specific business unit (i.e., a department) that has some influence on how the patient sees thehealthcare organization.</p>
<p>Internal Business Process. This perspective should gather all objectives related to
processes and the way these are monitored and fine-tuned in order to achieve both
excellence in financial accomplishments and patient satisfaction. In that sense, the
BSC approach is a constant business process reengineering process based upon
specific goals to meet and not on improving de facto established processes</p>
<p>Learning and Growth (innovation and vision). This is an important perspective of
a BSC implementation because it focuses on the objectives and goals to achieve
the incorporation of business innovation (e.g., installing a Positron Emission
Tomography Device) and the continuous education of medical and administrative
staff. In that sense, this perspective identifies measurable tasks in order to build
long-term growth and improvement. In the healthcare sector, improvement is also
measured by assessing the outcome of treatment and care.</p>
<p>These four perspectives comprise a framework, meaning that they must be assessed and
populated in accordance to each business case. In order to achieve this, one has to set
for each category a list of objectives that can be feasibly measured. To each objective,
a specific target should be set and the initiative to reach that target well described</p>
<p>The BSC approach retains the “traditional” financial perspective, which mostly focuses
on reporting about past events. Financial figures, even if prospected in the future by
statistical means, are inadequate for guiding and evaluating the journey that healthcare
institutions must make to create future value through innovation, knowledge, patient
satisfaction, employee empowerment, process refinement, technology assessment and
material management. In that sense, the three other cited perspectives are completing the
puzzle in order to create a more valid and future-oriented performance management
strategy. In recent years, there have been some implementations of BSC frameworks in
the healthcare sector mostly on a single institution base (i.e., a hospital, a clinic, an
information technology component). Readers are encouraged to read and assess the best
practices, cited as references to this chapter (Aidermark, 2001; Castaneda-Mendez,
Mangan, & Lavery, 1998; Forgione, 1997; Freeman, 2002; Gordon & Geiger, 1999;
Inamdar, Kaplan, & Bower, 2002; Oliveira J, 2001; Pink, Mc Killop, Schraa, Preyra,
Montgomery, & Baker, 2001; Tarantino, 2003; Weber, 1999)</p>
<p>The model in Figure 1 enables decision makers to also value how the latter three
perspectives have worked and thus it enables the measurement of intangible aspects of
a system. The measurements focus on a single strategy that can be easily broken down
to the various levels of depth, depending of the organization type. Thus, by using BSC</p>

    <p>one can create a top-to-bottom design of a system, starting up from the needed strategy
(what is the market, who are the customers, what are the critical processes, what is
required by the stakeholders) going down to design metrics, processes, structures and
finally the needed technical and functional specification to create an information system
and a knowledge management framework capable of producing the right data and serve
the strategy.</p>
<h1>Quality Assurance in Healthcare and
the Role of Information Technology</h1><hr>
<h2>Known Problems and Issues of the Healthcare Sector</h2><hr>
<p>It is rather of common knowledge that the healthcare sector is not a sector without
problems. Especially in Europe, the great majority of healthcare organizations are state
funded. This means that institutions have in some cases very restricted budgets to
satisfy their needs thus making performance management a critical issue in their daily
routine. Other common problems are increased bed coverage (some institutions are
almost at 100 percent), long length of stay, increased waiting lists, poor facilities, and so
on. Taking all this into account and adding the life-related processes, one can clearly see
that healthcare organizations are difficult to manage even for experienced managers of
other sectors. One could list some of the major issues that healthcare stakeholders are
confronted with:</p>
<ol>
<li> Diversity of cases</li>
<li> Need of high technology medical devices</li>
<li> Public Policy Restrictions (e.g., payment by per day quotas that do not cover the
inpatient treatment costs)</li>
<li> High lengths of stay</li>
<li> Increased waiting times</li>
<li> Obsolete facilities</li>
<li> Restricted funds for training</li>
<li> Restricted funds for maintenance</li>
<li> Increased number of medical errors (sometimes fatal)</li>
<li> Erroneous drug prescription and intake (sometime fatal)</li>
<li> Geographical issues (too many patients, too few nurses and medical staff)</li>
<li> Large lists of materials to be managed (more than 3000 on average)</li>
<li> Excessive waste management (10 m3per day on average)</li>
<h2>Quality Assurance and Performance Management</h2><hr>
<p>The application of a BSC framework will not by itself solve any of the aforementioned
problems and issues. One could even say that BSC projects often fail as a consequence
of misunderstanding or of not using a BSC strategy. BSC projects also fail because the
variables of the scorecard are incorrectly identified as the primary drivers and because
the improvement goals (the targeted objectives) are negotiated across an institution
instead of being based upon stakeholders’ requirements, fundamental processes and
improvement process capabilities. They also fail because there is no deployment system
installed to disseminate, maintain and promote the BSC framework, or because some very
important KPIs are not used, or metrics are poorly defined.</p>
<p>Furthermore in order to create a structure that can be monitored the KPIs should not be
more that 10 for each perspective, while non financial metrics should overcome the
financial metrics by approximately six to one (Schneiderman, 1999). In order to support
any BSC framework, a deployment and maintenance system based upon quality assurance specially designed for Healthcare should be established. Traditionally in healthcare,
Quality Assurance (QA) has been meant to apply predominantly to healthcare itself as
provided directly to patients by legitimate healthcare practitioners. We also include other
services that directly affect the ability of practitioners to perform well, meaning services
such as radiology, pharmaceutical, laboratory, and patient admission. The basic quality
assurance terms (Donabedian, 2003)</p>
